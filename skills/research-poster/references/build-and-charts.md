# Build approach + charts (native-editable, PowerPoint-safe)

Build the poster with **python-pptx** (>= 1.0). Everything is a native object: text boxes, rounded
rectangles for section bands and diagram boxes, stat tiles, and native charts. One editable data
block at the top of the build script drives every chart and callout, so updated numbers are a
one-line change. Assert every displayed percentage recomputes to the source number before saving.

Start from `examples/build_poster_native_example.py` (editable charts, the default) or
`examples/make_charts_image_example.py` (matplotlib images). Adapt content and house-style tokens;
do not rebuild the helpers (`rect`, `textbox`, `para`, `section_header`, `flow_column`, `stat_tile`).

## The one hard rule for native charts

PowerPoint validates chart XML on open. If it dislikes the XML it does not just warn, it
**"repairs" the file by deleting the chart** (dialog: "PowerPoint couldn't read some content ...
Repaired and removed it"). An A/B/C/D test isolated the trigger precisely:

- SAFE: per-slice fills, legend, percentage/value data labels, `number_format`,
  `number_format_is_linked = False`, axis tick-label fonts, native tables.
- BREAKS IT: **setting a doughnut/pie data-label POSITION** (e.g. `data_labels.position =
  XL_LABEL_POSITION.CENTER`). This alone makes PowerPoint repair-and-remove the chart.

So: never set `data_labels.position` on a doughnut/pie. Build charts fresh (never `replace_data` a
mismatched chart). Verify survival with `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect_repair.sh`.

## Doughnut recipe (editable, readable, no position setting)

Because you cannot set label position and cannot per-point-color labels reliably, do NOT put labels
on the slices. Instead:

- Put the percentage in the **legend text**: categories = `["Offers >=1 rotation (95%)",
  "No rotation (5%)"]`, legend at bottom, big font.
- Put the headline percentage as a **big number centered in the doughnut hole** (a separate
  textbox overlaid at the ring center, green, ~56pt).
- Per-slice fills via `plot.series[0].points[i].format.fill` (safe). Keep brand colors.
- `plot.has_data_labels = False`.

## Bar recipe (editable)

- `XL_CHART_TYPE.BAR_CLUSTERED`, series fill + per-point fills (safe).
- Data labels: `show_value = True`, `number_format = '0.0"%"'` (whole-number formats like `'0.#"%"'`
  render an ugly trailing dot "42.%"; `'0.0"%"'` gives clean "42.0%"). Green label font.
- Category and value axis tick-label fonts set for readability. Do not set label position.
- Give the value axis headroom so the longest bar's label does not clip.

## Editable vs image charts (the tradeoff)

- Native (default): fully editable in PowerPoint (double-click to change data/colors), tiny file,
  no repair prompt. Slightly less custom (no leader lines, standard label placement).
- Images (matplotlib): pixel-perfect (leader line for a tiny slice, exact label text, luminance-based
  label contrast) but not editable. Use when the author wants the most polished static look.

The matplotlib path (image example) also carries these fixes worth reusing if you go that way:
rotate the structure doughnut (`startangle`) so labels sit at top/bottom (never clip at 3/9 o'clock);
`clip_on=False` + inward label radius; give the bar `xlim` headroom; choose label color by wedge
luminance (dark text on light gold/gray, white on dark green); small slice label placed OUTSIDE with
a leader line.

## Honest chart-type choice

- **Doughnut / pie**: only for true parts-of-a-whole that sum to 100% (e.g. 95% offer / 5% none).
- **Horizontal bar**: for independent or NON-mutually-exclusive proportions that share a denominator
  but overlap (e.g. 42% interested, 26% pursued, 10.5% practice without fellowship). A pie here is
  statistically wrong.
- **Big-number tile**: for a single figure (response rate, states, a range).
- Always label the denominator (n/N) and keep any "preliminary / collection ongoing" framing.
